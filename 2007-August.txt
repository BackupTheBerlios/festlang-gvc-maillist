Message-ID: <1186519649.3132.27.camel@shadow.local>

Long mail below, so you can just answer on a question - is it possible
to have a new release of pocketsphinx?
---------------------------------
It's probably a question to David, but others are interested too. We
already have a lot of packaging requests from Ubuntu and Fedora and the
main problem here is the package for pocketsphinx. sphinx2 is present in
all major distributions but even from my recent experience it's much
slower than pocket one.

We are probably going to propose gvc for inclusion in gnome 2.22 in
September and it would be nice to have package too. I know a few fixes
were applied since last release that are critical for gvc. Time-based
schedule will be amazing but I know I request too much.

Subject: [Festlang-gvc] New actions added
Message-ID: <1186519716.3132.29.camel@shadow.local>

FUI, I've just added a list of actions it would be nice to implement:

    /* FIXME: the rest is not implemented */
    ACTION_UP,
    ACTION_DOWN,
    ACTION_LEFT,
    ACTION_RIGHT,
    ACTION_ESCAPE,
    ACTION_BACKSPACE,
    ACTION_DELETE,
    ACTION_INSERT,
    ACTION_HOME,
    ACTION_END,
    ACTION_PAGE_DOWN,
    ACTION_PAGE_UP,
    ACTION_ENTER,
    ACTION_SWITCH_LAYOUT,
    ACTION_MOUSE_LEFT,
    ACTION_MOUSE_RIGHT,
    ACTION_MOUSE_DOWN,
    ACTION_MOUSE_UP,
    ACTION_SHOW_HELP,
    ACTION_HOME_FOLDER,
    ACTION_SEARCH,
    ACTION_SHOW_DESKTOP,
    ACTION_COPY,
    ACTION_PASTE,
    ACTION_CUT,
    ACTION_LOCK_DESKTOP,

If you have more actions in a wish list, please suggest.

I'm also very excited with a dialog with computer, probably we should
investigate some more advanced features like "Buddy, say how many mails
do I have?", "Is there any news today?" No idea if they are
implementable though.

Yup, as soon as this stuff is done:

http://lima.lti.cs.cmu.edu/mediawiki/index.php/PocketSphinx#PocketSphinx_0.4.2C_SphinxBase_0.3.2C_Sphinx3_0.7

Actually the list of tasks for PocketSphinx is relatively small and some 
of them (allphone decoder, AT&T FSM format) could easily be dropped.  
The acoustic models are already trained.  So the main thing left to do 
is regression testing and fixing the Windows build...

If nobody else wants to do it I will make the Debian/Ubuntu packages of 
pocketsphinx and sphinxbase.  It's been a while since I was a Debian 
developer but I think I remember how to do it :)

Great, thanks a lot David. I'll look where I can help.

Another question I think this technique is critical for us:

https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4381329

To be honest I don't know how hard is it, can you estimate the time
required for such thing?

I started packaging for Ubuntu and after that I would submit it to
Debian. But, if you have free time feel free to do the packaging :).
Ubuntu request is at <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/129758>.
I still haven't made ITP on Debian's list, so please do that :).

Actually I don't really have the time to be an official Debian 
maintainer (for one I really only use Ubuntu these days), though I would 
be happy to help put together the packaging - could you send me the 
debian/ directory that you have so far?

I haven't started packaging it yet. I was trying to get
gnome-voice-control 0.2 into gutsy (BTW, g-v-c- 0.2 is uploaded and
waiting for archive admin approval :)). But I guess I could make an
initial one, do some work and send it to you (if you don't have time
for whole job, and I finished with g-v-c and another package I was
working on :)).

Raphael, I reviewed it and decided to not commit it right now. I need a
patch to existing docs, not the new document. Current documentation is
in help/C/gnome-voice-control.xml

Second, there is no need to describe installation, if user reads this
document it means applet is successfully installed. Just describe usage
and troubleshooting. About section can be extended of course.

I like your idea about pictures but please use C locale and standard
GNOME theme (Clearlooks) when you are taking screenshots for
documentation. Please don't use Portuguese in file names and
identifiers.

As we discussed we'll do it through gconf better, I'm waiting for
updated patch.

And it would be nice to have a patch for the feature we discussed before
- recognition only on keypress. I think it would be nice to have third
menu item in applet - Start control/Stop control/Keypress Control and a
radio to choose between them. As a key you can use Ctrl I suppose. Or a
mouse button.

Message-ID: <8cb76b010708120650l622b6fb4u8a7564a28aab83c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Would you please add to SVN a TODO for 1.0 release? This would help on
planning and it will also make it easier for newcomers to contribute,
knowing what needs to be done.

Some ideas:

1.0
implement all actions from gnome-keybinding-properties (easy, read with
gconf the keyboard shortcut and simulate it). Web browser might be firefox
not epiphany, so it's a better solution than current hardcoded one.

what else?

2.0
add intelligence (e.g. run web browser = open the web browser, close
current/this window, email John etc)

Hi Marius

Since we are target inclusion into GNOME release I'd really prefer a bit
different project management system - bugzilla + time-based releases. So
our releases will just follow a schedule independently from features. As
for a list of features we'll just use bug tracking database on
bugzilla.gnome.org. I've just requested a new component there:

http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=465952

As a list of features which would be nice to have till the end of
September, yeah, your list looks sensible, but I'd probably add support
for french model and some support for dictation (by letter for example
like in an4). Recognition on keypress is also sensible. Probably enough.

Please try something like the attached patch, it works fine for me. But
I suppose we should somehow make it better probably with
gdk_window_add_filter. For more details look into at-spi sources
(at-spi/registryd/deviceeventcontroller) and gdk_window_add filter
documentation. Although ally usage here also looks fine.

Subject: [Festlang-gvc] Updated acoustic model in PocketSphinx SVN
Message-ID: <46C1B340.6000601@cs.cmu.edu>

Hi,

In preparation for the next release of PocketSphinx I've re-trained the 
acoustic models that are included in the package.  They are now 
compatible with 8kHz sampling rate audio (which is all that a lot of 
mobile devices are able to do) and have been trained on more data, so 
they should perform significantly better.

However, to distinguish the new WSJ model from the old one, it has a 
different name.  Therefore the PocketSphinx arguments in 
gnome-voice-control will have to be updated to point to 
$pocketsphinx_prefix/share/model/hmm/wsj1 rather than wsj0.

I hope to release PocketSphinx 0.4 in the next week or two.

No problem :). Maybe you would like to add to g-v-c wiki that it's
installable in Ubuntu 7.10 by running the package manager, searching
for gnome-voice-control and then installing it. I'll submit this
package to Debian too and report when (and if) it gets uploaded.

No release notes yet, but I have uploaded it to SourceForge.  Major

 * Support for more platforms
 * Substantial code cleanup and smaller code footprint
 * Removed unused features
 * Much improved acoustic models (the included language models are still 
not very good though)

Message-ID: <706cf3130708191212w78bc1910ma2e7619ad4086faa@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I tried to run g-v-c in Ubuntu Gutsy, but the error window popped up, saying:
 * The panel encountered a problem while loading
"OAFIID:GNOME_VoiceControlApplet"
It asks me if I want to delete the applet or not. Do you know of this
problem and how to fix it?

Best regards,
Sa?a

Hi Sa?a, thanks for the report but it's really hard to say where is the
problem, can you just do the following:

1. Start applet binary from terminal
2. Try to add it to panel
3. When it crash look into terminal messages, is there something useful?

This article can be useful too:

Never mind!  I have gone ahead and packaged SphinxBase and PocketSphinx 
from the most recent releases.  I am not quite sure how to make an 
apt-able archive, but the packages are all living here for now:

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dhuggins/packages/feisty/

The binary packages are built on Ubuntu feisty, but probably (?) will 
work on Debian unstable.

Hello Nickolay,

I found what was the problem. The program installs it's binary in
libexec=$(prefix)/libexec, which is a directory that is not standard
(at least in Ubuntu). I had to change it, so I passed the
libexexec=/usr/lib/gnome-voice-control to configure. But there are two
places where the $(prefix)/libexec is used instead of $(libexec),
which breaks the program if $(libexec) is passed .
In data/Makefile.am, line 8:
APPLET_LOCATION=$(prefix)/libexec/voice_control_applet

In data/Makefile.in, line 222:
APPLET_LOCATION=$(prefix)/libexec/voice_control_applet

Changing the "$(prefix)/libexec" to "$(libexec)" fixes this problem.
Now the applet crashes when it starts listening, but that's another
bug :)... Does anyone know the build-deps that can be used instead
gnome-devel?

Best regards,
Sa?a

Subject: [Festlang-gvc] gnome-voice-control using standalone gst-sphinx
	plugins
Message-ID: <46CF2E27.4060707@cs.cmu.edu>

Hi,

I've merged some code from g-v-c into my standalone GStreamer plugins 
for Sphinx3 and PocketSphinx, which you can find at:

https://cmusphinx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cmusphinx/trunk/gst-sphinx

The very cool thing about these is that they enable ASR to work on the 
Nokia N800...

Anyway, I also extended these plugins to support FSG switching as done 
by g-v-c, and to verify that this works, I "ported" g-v-c over to the 
standalone PocketSphinx plugin (I actually don't know how to do FSG 
switching in Sphinx3, but once that works, we can try it out with the 
Sphinx3 decoder as well).

A patch (which you are not expected to apply) is attached here.

We should maybe talk about whether you want to continue to have your own 
internal plugin for Sphinx (which is a perfectly reasonable thing to 
do), or if you want to use the standalone ones which are not released 
yet, although I hope to make a 0.1 release soon if only so they could be 
packaged for Debian/Ubuntu/Maemo.

For my part, I *think* that the standalone plugins will be incorporated 
into the next releases of Sphinx3 and PocketSphinx but those could be a 
long way away.

Thanks David, amazing work.

I think we have nothing against standalone plugin. If we'll have a way
to detect it's presence (with .pc file for example) it's perfectly fine
to use it.

Although requirements for such plugin are not clear now, is it possible
to switch from fsg to dictation mode and back quickly?
