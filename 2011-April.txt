Hi ,

Thanks a lot for your support through out. Finally, i'm done with it. To GVC
i have added tamil models trained using SphinxTrain and also have added
speech output using festival, with the aim of  assisting the visually
impaired. Following is my blog on gnomeSpeak. I have added some screen casts
to it.

I appreciate your feedback on this. This would help me to evaluate my work
and improve.

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Hanitha
