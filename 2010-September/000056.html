<PRE>2010/9/3, Guillermo Perez &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/festlang-gvc">g.perez at indisys.es</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Hello Nickolay,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Spanish model available for Sphinx is built with Mexican-Spanish, we
</I>&gt;<i> need it for Spanish-Spanish. Furthermore, this model gives very low
</I>&gt;<i> recognition rates, mainly because it was built for large vocabulary
</I>&gt;<i> applications but with very few recordings.
</I>
CMUSphinx provides two models - Mexican Spanish and Spanish Spanish.
You probably need to revisit website and try a new model.

<A HREF="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/2010/08/voxforge-spanish-model-released/">http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/2010/08/voxforge-spanish-model-released/</A>

&gt;<i> We are building a specific acoustic model for the concrete set of commands
</I>&gt;<i> that will be used in this application. Our goal is to have a high
</I>&gt;<i> recognition rate.
</I>
I'm not sure how are you going to align concrete set of commands with
the GVC design able to dynamically build grammar from the interface. I
also don't think that you can get any significant gain from
specialized model. The model is somewhat important, but it's a minor
part of the whole application. And core issues with voice-based
command and control lie outside of the model training. Things like
WakeUpWord, adaptation and correction are way more important.

&gt;<i> Can I ask you why you wouldn't be happy with GVC independent of the
</I>&gt;<i> particular recognition engine used?
</I>
Why I should be happy? It introduce unneeded complexity without any
gain. I don't think that writing the API is something GVC should focus
on. Can you explain why do you need another engine? What are
advantages of Julius?

</PRE>
