<PRE>Hello Nickolay,

Please find attached the es_ES version of the .dict and .phone files.

Some comments:

1 - Of course, feel free to use, modify and distribute it if you think it 
can be useful.
2 - Changes in the .phone file:
    2.1 - I have deleted the &quot;V&quot; phoneme in the .phone file since there is 
no distinction with &quot;B&quot; in Spanish.
    2.2 - I have included the &quot;Z&quot; phoneme in the .phone file since there is 
a difference with &quot;S&quot; in certain cases.
3 - Changes in the .dict file:
    3.1 - Substitution of &quot;V&quot; by &quot;B&quot; phoneme in all cases
    3.2 - Substitution of &quot;S&quot; by &quot;Z&quot; in certain cases (namely, every 
occurance of letter &quot;z&quot; and some occurances of &quot;c&quot;, depending on the 
context: &quot;ce&quot;, &quot;ci&quot;)
    3.3 - Substitution of &quot;S&quot; by &quot;S Z&quot; in certain cases (namely, every 
occurance of letters &quot;sc&quot; followed by &quot;e&quot; or &quot;i&quot;).
    3.4 - Transciption of &quot;veru&#235;nza&quot; as &quot;B E R G U E N Z A&quot; (however, 
&quot;vergu&#235;nza&quot; is incorrect in Spanish. The correct word is &quot;verg&#252;enza&quot;).
4 - I have noticed what I believe to be bugs in the mx_ES version:
    4.1 - I beleive that points 2.1, 3.1 and 3.4 should be applied to mx_ES 
also.
    4.2 - The transcriptions of the words &quot;ejercicio&quot;, &quot;ejercicios&quot;, 
&quot;adyacente&quot; and &quot;subyace&quot; include &quot;K&quot; instead of &quot;S&quot; (&quot;Z&quot; in es_ES).
    4.3 - The transcription of the isolated letter &quot;C&quot; is &quot;K&quot;. I believe 
this is a mistake, it should be either &quot;S&quot; or &quot;S E&quot;.
5- Some questions that could imply additional changes (all of them apply to 
both es_ES and mx_ES):
    5.1 - The isolated letters are transcribed as phonemes. Shouldn't they 
be transcribed as a &quot;word&quot;? For instance &quot;D&quot; should be transcribed as &quot;D E&quot;.
    5.2 - There are foreign words that are litterally transcribed, while the 
pronounciation is generally adapted to the foreign one. For instance 
&quot;Chelsea&quot; is transcribed as &quot;CH E L S E A &quot; but one would actually read 
something like &quot;CH E L S I&quot;. There are several such words,     like 
&quot;Francesco&quot;, &quot;Jesse&quot;, &quot;Jessica&quot;, &quot;Goldshine&quot;, &quot;Stosic&quot;, &quot;Lawrence&quot;, 
&quot;Toulouse&quot;, &quot;Versace&quot;.
    5.3 - A similar case to the previous one is the set of words beginning 
with &quot;S&quot; followed by a consonant: e.g. &quot;Star&quot; is transcribed as &quot;S T A R&quot;, 
but one would add an &quot;E&quot; at the beginning: &quot;E S T A R&quot;. This applies to both 
es_ES and mx_ES.
    5.4 - The word &quot;EZLN&quot; (not &quot;_E_Z_L_N&quot;) is transcribed as &quot;E S L N&quot; in 
mx_ES. This is actually unpronounceable in Spanish, one would actually read 
it as &quot;_E_Z_L_N&quot;.
6 - Since the phoneme &quot;S&quot; has been splitted in &quot;S&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; for the es_ES 
version of the dict, there could be some missing contexts for these 
phonemes. For instance, I have noticed that there is no occurance of the 
triplets &quot;U Z B&quot; (used in &quot;Uzbekist&#225;n&quot;), &quot;S Z O&quot; (&quot;used in &quot;Deszocar&quot;) or &quot;S 
Z U&quot; (used in &quot;Deszumar&quot;). Is there anyway to check it?
7 - I believe that these modifications should improve the performance for 
es_ES speakers, but I haven't build the acoustic model with this 
dictionary... Could anyone do that?...
8 - Although we began our discussion within Gnome Voice Control mailing 
list, all of these points are very much Spanish-Sphinx related. Shouldn't we 
forward this mail to one of the cmusphinx mailing lists?

Regards,
Guillermo
