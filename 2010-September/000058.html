<PRE>I agree with you: let's wait for the numbers. As soon as we complete our 
acoustic model we will make this comparison and share it with you.

However we have already identified a problem with the Spanish model from 
Sphinx: the .phone file doesn't include the &quot;Z&quot; phoneme (needed in Spanish, 
not in mexican). The .dic is also wrong (e.g. &quot;MAXIMIZAR&quot; is transcribed as 
&quot;M A X I M I S A R&quot;). We can change the .dic, but we need the model to be 
trained correctly with all the Spanish phonemes. I think we should talk to 
the Sphinx guys.

Regarding the HTK converter, we discarded it at the beginning because the 
old version seemed not to work very well. There is a new one that has just 
been released, but we have not tried it yet. However, it looks easier to use 
an engine that allows you to use the models without an intermediate 
conversion.

&gt;<i> Thanks for this link! It seems that it has just been released, I was
</I>&gt;<i> not aware. I thought you meant the old (mexican) one, sorry. Of course
</I>&gt;<i> we are going to try it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is true that we lose flexibility by having a fixed predefined set
</I>&gt;<i> of commands, but we believe that it will let us have higher
</I>&gt;<i> recognition rates.
</I>
It's better to discuss numbers here. Without that it's hard to plan
anything. I think in realistic conditions with background noise and OOV
words you'll get 10% WER both on generic model and hand-made small
vocabulary model.

&gt;<i> Sphinx is also great, but Julius let us use HTK. From our point of
</I>&gt;<i> view, this is a very important advantage if you need to build new
</I>&gt;<i> models (which is the case of most of the languages).
</I>
Again, without numbers it's hard to discuss this. My goal is to point
you that to make this decision you need fair comparison. FYI, you can
use HTK models in CMUSphinx. The conversion scripts are available on the
website.
