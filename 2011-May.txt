Hi folks.

We (GNOME Accessibility Team) are attempting to ascertain the current
status and future plans of relevant modules, including GNOME Voice
Control.

In particular:

* At the moment, GNOME Voice Control seems to depend upon CSPI which
  was deprecated. Are there plans to move to libatspi [1] so that
  GNOME Voice Control can be used in GNOME 3?

* Is there a project/team roadmap?

* Are there plans to move the code to git.gnome.org?

Thank you in advance for any information you can provide us! Take care.
