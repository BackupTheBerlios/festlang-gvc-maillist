Subject: [Festlang-gvc] [PATCH] Add window mode to ease debugging
Message-ID: <494B0E6A.60901@yahoo.com>

This patch add a --window  switch to run the applet from the console 
(the applet_factory around voice_control_applet_factory is not needed 
.... just tell me if you want this added layer removed and I ll resubmit 
a new patch).

I hope that with this ease of debugging I ll be able to send fixes for 
the segfaults I encounter .
One of those I have worked around by adding:

        if (GST_SPHINX_SINK(voice_control->sink)->ad.initialized ) {

around the code in voice-control.c :
static void
voice_control_ui_changed (ControlSpiListener *listener, gpointer data)

because on my setup ps_init is too slow and the decoder_init from 
gstsphinxsink.c is not run before the ui is updated (or so I think it is 
what s happening right now, feel free to correct me). This crash happens 
in gst_sphinx_sink_set_fsg/gst_spinx_construct_fsg called from 
voice_control_ui_changed because sink->decoder is null  for the first ui 
change.

Still I now get a crash again in ui_changed but this time while 
ps_update_fsgs is called. I hope to be able to fix this one but it is 
not as obvious as the one I fixed with the previous change.

I cannot wait for a version that understand french .-)

Cheers
Alban


PS: I had it working without a flow a few days ago (before Xorg 1.6 
upgrade which removed xevie support and a recompile of at-spi with 
--disable-xevie because otherwise it fails to start the registry without 
xevie behing there.)
I believe that most of the issue I encounter are due to at-spi without 
xevie behing slower by order of magnitude than with xevie. Still as it 
could not hurt to fix those crashes and though it seems somebody have 
stepped up to bring back xevie in xorg this is not done yet and xorg 1.6 
(1.5.99) is currently in ubuntu jaunty.

Hey Alban, great work. Create yourself an account on berlios and I'll
happily add you to the developers! You'll be able to commit your patch
yourself.

Nice catch! Actually we can create a callback and start UI lookup only
when decoder is initialized.

Well, it's possible right now, you just need to translate it to french
with fr.po and create a dictionary. Also you need to package existing
acoustic model from sphinx downloads in a special way so it will be
handled by the decoder.
