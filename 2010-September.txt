Subject: [Festlang-gvc] GVC in Spanish with Julius
Message-ID: <4FDB591A08444564970C5D498D0A5217@Latitude>

Hello,

We are working with Gnome Voice Control, trying to make it work in Spanish. We are now building the Spanish acoustic model, but in the mean time we are also making general changes to the system, including:

- Refactoring of "voice_control" to make the main process independent of the ASR and language chosen
- Refactoring of "voice_control" and "spi_listener" to make the main process independent of gstream
- Implementation of a general ASR interface (independent of the particular engine)
- Integration of Julius as an alternative to Sphinx
- Expanding the set of commands
- Some minor changes in the Spanish translation of the commands

We would like to make our changes available as part of the Gnome Voice Control project. How should we proceed?

Kind regards,
Guillermo

If you want to continue development on Berlios, register there, I will
add you to the project manager. Subscribe to bugzilla component. Also
feel free to take over live.gnome.org page. I don't think
gnome-voice-control has any other resources.

CMUSphinx provides two models - Mexican Spanish and Spanish Spanish.
You probably need to revisit website and try a new model.

http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/2010/08/voxforge-spanish-model-released/

I'm not sure how are you going to align concrete set of commands with
the GVC design able to dynamically build grammar from the interface. I
also don't think that you can get any significant gain from
specialized model. The model is somewhat important, but it's a minor
part of the whole application. And core issues with voice-based
command and control lie outside of the model training. Things like
WakeUpWord, adaptation and correction are way more important.

Why I should be happy? It introduce unneeded complexity without any
gain. I don't think that writing the API is something GVC should focus
on. Can you explain why do you need another engine? What are
advantages of Julius?

It's better to discuss numbers here. Without that it's hard to plan
anything. I think in realistic conditions with background noise and OOV
words you'll get 10% WER both on generic model and hand-made small
vocabulary model.

Again, without numbers it's hard to discuss this. My goal is to point
you that to make this decision you need fair comparison. FYI, you can
use HTK models in CMUSphinx. The conversion scripts are available on the
website.

I agree with you: let's wait for the numbers. As soon as we complete our 
acoustic model we will make this comparison and share it with you.

However we have already identified a problem with the Spanish model from 
Sphinx: the .phone file doesn't include the "Z" phoneme (needed in Spanish, 
not in mexican). The .dic is also wrong (e.g. "MAXIMIZAR" is transcribed as 
"M A X I M I S A R"). We can change the .dic, but we need the model to be 
trained correctly with all the Spanish phonemes. I think we should talk to 
the Sphinx guys.

Regarding the HTK converter, we discarded it at the beginning because the 
old version seemed not to work very well. There is a new one that has just 
been released, but we have not tried it yet. However, it looks easier to use 
an engine that allows you to use the models without an intermediate 
conversion.

Yes, sorry about that, I often confuse them. I mean Castilian of course.

The current model is very accurate, it has 96.5% accuracy on test set,
way more than English Voxforge model (90%). Of course we can try your
alternative dictionary and compare.

Yes, please do.

Thanks Guillermo, that's a great job. I've retrained model already which is here

https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/Acoustic%20and%20Language%20Models/Voxforge%20Spanish/voxforge-es-0.1.1.tar.gz/download

It appears to be more accurate then previous one, you were right about it.

I suggest you to try to build model yourself, its very easy comparing
to HTK. And you will be able to fix bugs and add more data there.

Thats a great summary. Probably in the future we'll need to fix the
method we build
the dictionary for spanish. It might be the assistance from Festival
TTS voice or other
TTS system or machine learning or hand-made rules. It would be nice to
have a code to be able to build pronunciation for arbitrary word. It
should be doable for Spanish. That text could include pronunciation
variants for Mexican Spanish

That's up to you. I'm comfortable with both.

Actually we worked in a previous project with Festival. We built a couple of 
Spanish voices (male/female) that can be downloaded from 
http://forja.guadalinex.org/frs/download.php/249/JuntaDeAndalucia_es_pa_diphone.zip. 
During this project we had to improve the pronunciation module, including 
the addenda (equivalent to the pronounciation dictionary) and the letter to 
sound rules (the hand-made rules you mentioned). Both modules are included 
in the "JuntaDeAndalucia_es_pa_lexicon.scm" file within the zip file.

You can of course use these files if you find them useful. However, there 
are two drawbacks:

- The set of phonemes is different (larger)
- It is written in LISP...

Well, some of my comments apply to both mx-ES and es-ES, so at least we 
should talk to the guy responsible for the mexican model. Do you know who he 
is?

Hello Nickolay,

Please find attached the es_ES version of the .dict and .phone files.

Some comments:

1 - Of course, feel free to use, modify and distribute it if you think it 
can be useful.
2 - Changes in the .phone file:
    2.1 - I have deleted the "V" phoneme in the .phone file since there is 
no distinction with "B" in Spanish.
    2.2 - I have included the "Z" phoneme in the .phone file since there is 
a difference with "S" in certain cases.
3 - Changes in the .dict file:
    3.1 - Substitution of "V" by "B" phoneme in all cases
    3.2 - Substitution of "S" by "Z" in certain cases (namely, every 
occurance of letter "z" and some occurances of "c", depending on the 
context: "ce", "ci")
    3.3 - Substitution of "S" by "S Z" in certain cases (namely, every 
occurance of letters "sc" followed by "e" or "i").
    3.4 - Transciption of "veru?nza" as "B E R G U E N Z A" (however, 
"vergu?nza" is incorrect in Spanish. The correct word is "verg?enza").
4 - I have noticed what I believe to be bugs in the mx_ES version:
    4.1 - I beleive that points 2.1, 3.1 and 3.4 should be applied to mx_ES 
also.
    4.2 - The transcriptions of the words "ejercicio", "ejercicios", 
"adyacente" and "subyace" include "K" instead of "S" ("Z" in es_ES).
    4.3 - The transcription of the isolated letter "C" is "K". I believe 
this is a mistake, it should be either "S" or "S E".
5- Some questions that could imply additional changes (all of them apply to 
both es_ES and mx_ES):
    5.1 - The isolated letters are transcribed as phonemes. Shouldn't they 
be transcribed as a "word"? For instance "D" should be transcribed as "D E".
    5.2 - There are foreign words that are litterally transcribed, while the 
pronounciation is generally adapted to the foreign one. For instance 
"Chelsea" is transcribed as "CH E L S E A " but one would actually read 
something like "CH E L S I". There are several such words,     like 
"Francesco", "Jesse", "Jessica", "Goldshine", "Stosic", "Lawrence", 
"Toulouse", "Versace".
    5.3 - A similar case to the previous one is the set of words beginning 
with "S" followed by a consonant: e.g. "Star" is transcribed as "S T A R", 
but one would add an "E" at the beginning: "E S T A R". This applies to both 
es_ES and mx_ES.
    5.4 - The word "EZLN" (not "_E_Z_L_N") is transcribed as "E S L N" in 
mx_ES. This is actually unpronounceable in Spanish, one would actually read 
it as "_E_Z_L_N".
6 - Since the phoneme "S" has been splitted in "S" and "Z" for the es_ES 
version of the dict, there could be some missing contexts for these 
phonemes. For instance, I have noticed that there is no occurance of the 
triplets "U Z B" (used in "Uzbekist?n"), "S Z O" ("used in "Deszocar") or "S 
Z U" (used in "Deszumar"). Is there anyway to check it?
7 - I believe that these modifications should improve the performance for 
es_ES speakers, but I haven't build the acoustic model with this 
dictionary... Could anyone do that?...
8 - Although we began our discussion within Gnome Voice Control mailing 
list, all of these points are very much Spanish-Sphinx related. Shouldn't we 
forward this mail to one of the cmusphinx mailing lists?

Regards,
Guillermo
