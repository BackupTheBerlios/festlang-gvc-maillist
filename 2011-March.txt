Hello Nickolay,

As discussed in previous conversations, you can find attached some test results we did with our acoustic and language model. The results have been obtained for Spanish with Julius engine. In the pdf file are included both the individual results and the ROC curve, with and overall result of 85%.

Regarding GVC, we are finally going to commit our changes to the svn repository. Do you think we should first make a tag for the 0.4 version?

Regards,
Guillermo
