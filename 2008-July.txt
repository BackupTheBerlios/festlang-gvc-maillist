Hi Nickolay:

At voxForge we want to use some prompts from 
http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/sphinx/models/hub4spanish_itesm/ to improve 
spanish support, but we can't find any licence information (Ken at 
voxforge nee some licence clarification to be sure that is ok to use 
those files and content), also we don't get any response from Dr. 
Nolazco, that is a page related to cmu sphinx, may be you know something 
about licence of that?.
Specially licence info about the train.corpus_tst25pct_c file that you 
recomend me for the submission applet prompts.

Thanks

Mauricio

Hi

To be honest I don't know what should you do with the prompts. I think
you can just drop them and start recording texts from public sources.
It's not so important actually.

I agree with nsh.  Just make your own collection of prompts.  Make
sure you use stuff that no one will claim the copyright to.

For example

use sayings (I am sure you can find lists of Spanish sayings on the
Internet, and most of them will be quite old, and practically no one
will know who used it for the first time).

Copy and paste single sentences from weather forecasts.  They contain
very simple sentences like: tomorrow will be a sunny day... the
maximum temperature for tomorrow will be twenty degrees.

Or use old (out of copyright) books, however avoid using tongue
twisters (sentences that are really hard to pronounce) and words that
no one uses anymore.

I'm sure you can think of many more examples like those

Robin

To answer more properly, you need to checkout lastest development
version from trunk for pocketsphinx and sphinxbase 0.5. Unfortunately we
have no release yet.

And, this developement version is buggy to, don't enable ally with it.
But it should work better on 64 bit.
