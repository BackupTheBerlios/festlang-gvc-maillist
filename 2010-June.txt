Hi,

I've been trying to find decent voice control software for Linux and
this is the nearest to my needs that I've found.

I'm wondering if there's any activity on this project. I have ideas
etc and would like to make some changes.

I worked as a programmer for a year after my degree, but haven't done
much since then. I'm willing to get stuck in, but was hoping for some
guidance etc.

Basically, is there anybody out there?

There is no activity on this project right now. Partially thats because GNOME project discredited itself with absense of vision, leadership and constant
changes for nothing. Not quite professional approach they have repels the developers from it.

Among other projects that are actively developed right now are

http://simon-listens.org (could increase it's quality being ported to CMUSphinx)
http://vedics.sourceforge.net (rather naive thing).

You are welcome to do that.

Feel free to ask.

Hi,

Thanks for the reply.

Basically I'm after a system to do basic actions like "click" and "run
browser", but would love to be able to do free dictation, I know this
isn't easy so was hoping to get something that you can spell to for
the short term.

There seems to be various things about, but most seem to be old and
dead, or are science projects rather then applications.

I like GVC because I could just add it on Ubuntu from a repository,
add it to the panel, and it just (just about) worked.

The two main features I'd want to add to it are:
a) Calibration. Presumably if I trained sphinx then it would work
better to my voice, so surely a 5 minute calibration tool would
improve results.
b) Alphabet dictation. (bit hacky, but would be quite useful).

What would you recommend? Reviving GVS? or going for another project?
I've had a look at Simon, and it just doesn't seem very user friendly,
and is quite scary from a users standpoint. VEDICS seems to be similar
to GVS, but is only just getting started.

Thanks

It's sensless to spend your time on spelling. To implement dictation system
you need to learn how is it done on practice and do it. There is voicekeyboard 
project on sourceforge. There is evaldictator project from CMU.

The closest one project is Parakeet http://www.keithv.com/software/parakeet/
To implement dictation you need to build the following components:

1. Initial voice enrollement for adaptation (if you haven't seen how is it
done in Dragon Natural Speaking take a look).

2. Acoustic model adaptation.

3. Enrollment for language model adaptation

4. Language model adaptation

5. Optimization of the decoder to run at realtime speed

6. Correction interface to efficiently correct errors.

The question of putting it into GVC or making it standalone thing is most
minor one here.

Yes, usability is weak side of all KDE applications unfortunately
