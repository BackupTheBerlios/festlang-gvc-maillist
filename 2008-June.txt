As I said in irc, this is really a very reasonable item in TODO list.
LTS system included in recognizer could greatly reduce the memory
footprint as well as can help with OOV words. Another point I'm working
at now (not related to sphinx directly though) is n-best LTS. Instead of
single pronunciation it will generate variants for recognizer to match.
This way performance will be also improved. 

The work for such system was partially implemented in sphinx3 for
English with CART tree, but I afraid it will not fit in current
pocketsphinx architecture. So more work is still required.
