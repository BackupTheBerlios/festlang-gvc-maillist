<PRE>Hi,

Thanks for the reply.

Basically I'm after a system to do basic actions like &quot;click&quot; and &quot;run
browser&quot;, but would love to be able to do free dictation, I know this
isn't easy so was hoping to get something that you can spell to for
the short term.

There seems to be various things about, but most seem to be old and
dead, or are science projects rather then applications.

I like GVC because I could just add it on Ubuntu from a repository,
add it to the panel, and it just (just about) worked.

The two main features I'd want to add to it are:
a) Calibration. Presumably if I trained sphinx then it would work
better to my voice, so surely a 5 minute calibration tool would
improve results.
b) Alphabet dictation. (bit hacky, but would be quite useful).

What would you recommend? Reviving GVS? or going for another project?
I've had a look at Simon, and it just doesn't seem very user friendly,
and is quite scary from a users standpoint. VEDICS seems to be similar
to GVS, but is only just getting started.

Thanks

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;I have ideas etc and would like to make some changes.
