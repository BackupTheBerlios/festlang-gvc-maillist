Subject: [Festlang-gvc] GVC - Segmentation fault when configuring with own
	model
Message-ID: <AANLkTinug1dxyyiggfTvQ=OAh6Nf6AyUmw4Awo2GqksP@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ,

I created my own models for tamil language using spinxtrain.
Was able to successfully decode with pocketsphinx.

I wanted to add it to gvc . These are the steps i did.
1. Generated kdtrees using following comand
./kdtree  -outfn kdtrees -meanfn means -varfn variances -threshold 0.2
-depth 8

2. Generated the mdef bmp file.
pocketsphinx_mdef_convert build/voxforge/mdef2 build/voxforge/mdef

3. Placed my model directory in the following path
/home/hani/build/pocketsphinx/model/hmm/voxforge-ta

4. Created my lm folder in following path
/home/hani/build/pocketsphinx/model/lm/voxforge-ta
copied my dmp , dictionay files to it.

5. Also copied my dictionay file to following location
/home/hani/build/gnome-voice-control/lang/desktop-control-ta.dict

6. I change the gstsphinxsink.c as follows
 result = g_strdup_printf ("voice-control "
    "-fwdflat no "
    "-bestpath yes "
    "-dictcase yes "
    "-hmm " POCKETSPHINX_PREFIX "/share/pocketsphinx/model/hmm/voxforge-ta "

    "-fsg " GNOMEDATADIR "/gnome-voice-control/desktop-control.fsg "
    "-dict " GNOMEDATADIR "/gnome-voice-control/desktop-control-ta.dict ");

When 'Start Control' i get segmentation fault. Error looks like coming when
try to call ps_update_fsgset (sink->decoder) in gst_sphinx_sink_set_fsg
procedure.

Where am i going wrong ?

Thanks,
Hani

You are using outdated pocketsphinx, try newer version

But now i'm getting the same error at the same line for default english

Good, now you probably want to read the output of the applet which
contains the description of the error.

Thanks Nickolay.

1. sorry, i could n't figure out what u meant by output of the applet.
I'm debugging by locking the voice-control-applet in the terminal and then
adding to the panel.

2. Initially there was an error abt a duplicate entry in the
desktop-control-en-dict.
Yesterday i got segmentation fault when try to call ps_update_fsgset
(sink->decoder) in gst_sphinx_sink_set_fsg procedure.
today when i redo the dictionary editing the error is fixed. Now It is
listening. Most of the time as soon as it executes the command, i get
segmentation fault. Looks like coming in the same point.
Please find my log entry attached in eng_log file.
Though log file is for wsj1 models from pocketsphinc 0.5.1, behaviour was
same for en_US models from pocketsphinx0.6.1

3. when i use the tamil model it gave segmentation fault as before. Error
looks like coming when try to call ps_update_fsgset (sink->decoder) in
gst_sphinx_sink_set_fsg procedure.
Please find my log entry attached in ta_log file
also tamil hmm and lmm folders attached.

Thank you.
Hani

Hello

You are on the right track, only minor issues left now ;)

No, it can't be the same. I recommend you to carefully check you are NOT
using 0.5.1

Those logs are useless for me. If you want to debug segmentation
violations you need to use the debugger. You can learn more about
collecting traces here:

Thanks for your information Nickolay.

I managed to debug using gdb and log files are attached.

1. english_log.txt :
dict file : gvc desktop-control-en.dict
model : /pocketsphinx/model/hmm/en_US/hub4wsj_sc_8k
sigsegv error comes for run browser command, It executed many other commands
successfully

2.eng_log_with_cmu07a.txt
dict file : /pocketsphinx/model/lm/en_US/cmu07a.dic
model : /pocketsphinx/model/hmm/en_US/hub4wsj_sc_8k
sigsegv error comes for 'Start Control' action

3. tamil_log.txt (Own model and dict file)
dict file : /pocketsphinx/model/hmm/voxforge-ta
model : pocketsphinx 0.6.1 -> voxforge-ta
sigsegv error comes for 'Start Control' action

P.S: english model directories renamed to voxforge-en , dictionary files to
desktop-control-en.dict and used.

Regards,
Hani

Ok, there was a minor bug in GVC which caused this silence, it actually
had to print you a error about missing word. This bug is now fixed in
GVC trunk, please checkout latest version and try it. It has some
features which can help you with debugging, for example --window option
to start an application in a window instead of applet.
