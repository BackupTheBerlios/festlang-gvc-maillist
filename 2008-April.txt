Hello!

I think GVC is a great project... which can find great applications.

so i'd like to understand it.

I have compiled GVC 0.2 and add new command but i realized that some words
are not in the dictionnary.
So I added them but there this file

desktop-control.fsg

how does it work? it for the sentences?

could some help me to understand it please..

thanks!

Hi Opax, welcome to gvc.

First of all please checkout/download the latest version -
gnome-voice-control-0.3. It has some important modifications.

Next, about fsg. As you see it describes the grammar recognizer
understands. But this grammar is not actually contained in
desktop-control.fsg. In latest version this file is just empty. The real
grammar is built on the fly by gst_sphinx_sink_set_fsg function. Words
from commands and UI elements are included there from ally introspection
information.

If you need to add another command, open the file action.c and add a
command for existing action or even add a new action. Remember that the
word you'd like to add must be in the dictionary as well.


If you have more questions, feel free to ask or join #cmusphinx channel
on freenode.
